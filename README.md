# XAUUSD_TRADING_workflow
üß© Explanation ‚Äì XAUUSD SMC Trading Workflow in n8n
This n8n workflow is designed to support an automated trading strategy for XAUUSD, based on Smart Money Concepts (SMC) and ICT (Inner Circle Trader) methodology. It acts as an integration layer between MetaTrader 5 (MT5) and Telegram, and optionally a logging system like Google Sheets or Notion.

‚úÖ Core Purpose
The goal of the workflow is to handle incoming trade signals from MT5 (generated by an Expert Advisor using SMC logic), filter them based on session timing, format them into a readable message, and forward them to Telegram for real-time monitoring.

üß† Workflow Logic Overview
1. Webhook Trigger (MT5 Signal Receiver)
This is the entry point for the workflow. The MT5 EA sends a POST request to the webhook whenever a trade is executed based on predefined SMC logic (e.g., FVG, BOS, liquidity grab). The payload contains all necessary trade metadata: entry price, SL, TP, session, reason, and scenario outlook.

2. Session Filtering (IF Node)
Not all sessions are valid for trading SMC strategies. The IF node filters incoming requests, allowing only those that are triggered during London or New York trading sessions. This prevents false entries during low-liquidity periods like Asian session.

Copy code
{{$json["session"] === "London" || $json["session"] === "New York"}}
This expression ensures only institutional-grade market hours are considered valid.

3. Message Formatting (Set Node)
The Set node prepares a structured message using the data received from MT5. This includes the asset symbol, SL/TP levels, the logic behind trade execution, and both optimistic and risk-oriented outcome projections. Markdown is used for rich formatting in Telegram.

Example message content:

yaml
Copy code
ü¶æ XAUUSD Trade Opened (SMC Strategy)

Entry: 2350.50  
SL: 2346.00  
TP: 2362.00  
Session: New York

üß† Reason: FVG + BOS + Liquidity sweep

‚úÖ Best Case: TP Hit: +115 pips  
‚ö†Ô∏è Worst Case: SL Hit: -45 pips
This gives the trader or analyst immediate situational awareness of the trade‚Äôs foundation.

4. Telegram Notification (Telegram Node)
The message is sent to a specified Telegram chat (group, channel, or user) via a bot. Markdown is enabled to preserve formatting. This gives the trader live, mobile-friendly notifications every time a trade is placed, with clear rationales and risk-reward visuals.

5. (Optional) Trade Logging (Google Sheets / Notion)
An optional path can log each trade to a structured database. Google Sheets or Notion can serve as a lightweight trade journal, allowing post-trade analytics, win/loss tracking, and performance monitoring of the SMC system over time.

üì° Integration with MT5
This workflow expects a webhook POST call from your EA using this format:

# json
*
{
  "symbol": "XAUUSD",
  "entry": 2350.50,
  "sl": 2346.00,
  "tp": 2362.00,
  "session": "New York",
  "reason": "FVG + BOS + Liquidity sweep",
  "best_case": "TP Hit: +115 pips",
  "worst_case": "SL Hit: -45 pips"
}
*
The EA must detect SMC conditions and use WebRequest() to send this JSON payload to:
